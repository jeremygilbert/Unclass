<h1>Darkwing Duck</h1>
<p>Darkwing Duck was an Animated Action Adventure television series produced by <a href= "http://thewaltdisneycompany.com/">The Walt Disney Company</a>. It ran from 1991-1992. It featured the eponymous anthropomorphic duck superhero whose alter ego is mild-mannered single quacker Drake Mallard. It is the only direct spin-off of DuckTales. </p>
<h2>Premise</h2>
<p>Darkwing Duck tells the adventures of the titular superhero, aided by his sidekick and pilot Launchpad McQuack. In his secret identity of Drake Mallard, he lives in an unassuming suburban house with his adopted daughter Gosalyn, next door to the bafflingly dim-witted Muddlefoot family. Darkwing struggles to balance his egotistical craving for fame and attention against his desire to be a good father to Gosalyn and help do good in St. Canard. Most episodes put these two aspects of Darkwing's character in direct conflict, though Darkwing's better nature usually prevails.[2]
 It was the first Disney Afternoon cartoon to emphasize action rather than adventure, with Darkwing routinely engaging in slapstick battles with both supervillains and street criminals. While conflict with villains was routine in earlier Disney Afternoon, actual fight scenes were relatively rare.</p>
<h2>Main Characters</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Darkwing Duck/Drake Mallard</strong> (voiced by Jim Cummings) - Average citizen by day and St. Canard's resident superhero by night. He possesses a mix of courageous altruism and a gigantic arrogance and ego, two drives that constantly clash during his adventures - in "Just Us Justice Ducks", he was initially mortified that he'd be getting help against the Fearsome Five.</li>
	<li><strong>Launchpad McQuack</strong> (voiced by Terry McGovern) - Darkwing Duck's sidekick, originally from DuckTales. He refers to Darkwing as "DW" and Darkwing sometimes refers to him as "LP" in return. He's Darkwing's self-proclaimed biggest fan.</li>
	<li><strong>Gosalyn Mallard</strong> (née <strong>Waddlemeyer</strong>) (voiced by Christine Cavanaugh) – Drake Mallard's 9-year-old adopted daughter. An unstoppable bundle of energy and spunk, which Darkwing has said is more of a handful than fighting evil ("Getting Antsy").</li> 
</ul>
<h3>Broadcast history</h3>

<h3> What One Review Says</h3>
<p><blockquote><em>Disney Afternoon's response to Batman, but with a duck looking more The Shadow than The Dark Knight, is one of the many reasons why after-school cartoons rule. This DuckTales spin-off ran from 1991 to 1995, and during that time the goofy yet thrilling adventures of Drake Mallard never ceased to satisfy. And how could they not: awesome sidekick who was more Han Solo than Dick Grayson? Check, his name's Launchpad and he's about 10 different types of cool. Duck-themed aerial transport? Check. A few homages to Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns? Some nods to James Bond and Marvel for good measure? Double-check. And that theme song makes for a geeky-cool ringtone, which is nice. From DW's misadventures with Gizmoduck to some throw-downs with villain Flintheart Glomgold, our time in the city of St. Canard was more than worthwhile. It was pure fun.</em></blockquote></p>

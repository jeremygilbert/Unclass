		Darkwing Duck is an Animated Action Adventure television series produced by <a href="http://disney.com" target="_blank">The Walt Disney Company</a> that ran from 1991–1992 on both the syndicated programming block The Disney Afternoon and Saturday mornings on ABC.[1] It featured the eponymous anthropomorphic duck superhero whose alter ego is mild-mannered single quacker Drake Mallard. It is the only direct spin-off of DuckTales.
		
	
		<h1>Premise</h1>    
            <p>Darkwing Duck tells the adventures of the titular superhero, aided by his sidekick and pilot Launchpad McQuack. In his secret identity of Drake Mallard, he lives in an unassuming suburban house with his adopted daughter Gosalyn, next door to the bafflingly dim-witted Muddlefoot family. Darkwing struggles to balance his egotistical craving for fame and attention against his desire to be a good father to Gosalyn and help do good in St. Canard. Most episodes put these two aspects of Darkwing's character in direct conflict, though Darkwing's better nature usually prevails</p>
        <h1>Main Characters</h1>    
		    <ul>
    	        <li><b>Darkwing Duck / Drake Mallard</b> (voiced by Jim Cummings) – Average citizen by day and St. Canard's resident superhero by night. He possesses a mix of courageous altruism and a gigantic arrogance and ego, two drives that constantly clash during his adventures - in "Just Us Justice Ducks", he was initially mortified that he'd be getting help against the Fearsome Five. Darkwing's origins are rather fuzzy. On one hand, he frequently claims to be a superhero on the day he became Darkwing Duck after his teenage days. On the other hand, during his childhood and teenage days, Drake was a complete dork; by his high school days, however, he'd already developed an obsession with crime-fighting ("Crash Reunion"). He's been an active superhero for an unknown number of years. </li>
                <li><b>Launchpad McQuack</b> (voiced by Terry McGovern) – Darkwing Duck's sidekick, originally from DuckTales. He refers to Darkwing as "DW" and Darkwing sometimes refers to him as "LP" in return. He's Darkwing's self-proclaimed biggest fan, even spending a year designing the Thunderquack just out of fanboy urges; the hero originally found him annoying but quickly came to see him as a friend. As GizmoDuck also appears in the show, it's confirmed that Launchpad is no longer working for Scrooge. In the episode "Tiff of the Titans" when Fenton comes to visit Lauchpad, he explains to Drake Mallard that "Fenton and I used to work for the same guy"</li>

        <h3>The Critics: <a href="http://www.latimes.com" target="_blank">The Las Angeles Times</a></h3>    
		<p> Disney Comics published a four-issue Darkwing Duck comic book mini-series in late 1991, right around the time of the show's syndicated premiere. This mini-series was an adaptation of a draft of the script for "Darkly Dawns the Duck". Like the TaleSpin comic before it, it was meant to spin off a regular comic series, but the Disney Comics implosion happening at the time prevented that plan. However, Darkwing Duck stories were regularly printed in Disney Adventures magazine between the November 1991 and January 1996 issues. Additionally, Darkwing Duck stories were also regularly featured in Marvel Comics' short-lived Disney Afternoon comic book.</p>

	<h1>Darkwing Duck</h1>
		<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ef/Darkwing_duck.jpg"> This Animated Action Adventure television series produced by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company">The Walt Disney Company</a> that ran from 1991-1992 on both the syndicated programming block The Disney Afternoon and Saturday mornings on ABC.[1] It featured the eponymous anthropomorphic duck superhero whose alter ego is mild-mannered single quacker Drake Mallard. It is the only direct spin-off of DuckTales.</p>
	<h2>Premise</h2>
		<p>Darkwing Duck tells the adventures of the titular superhero, aided by his sidekick and pilot Launchpad McQuack. In his secret identity of Drake Mallard, he lives in an unassuming suburban house with his adopted daughter Gosalyn, next door to the bafflingly dim-witted Muddlefoot family. Darkwing struggles to balance his egotistical craving for fame and attention against his desire to be a good father to Gosalyn and help do good in St. Canard. Most episodes put these two aspects of Darkwing's character in direct conflict, though Darkwing's better nature usually prevails.</p>
	<h2>Main Characters</h2>
		<ul>
		<li><strong>Darkwing Duck / Drake Mallard</strong> (voiced by Jim Cummings) - Average citizen by day and St. Canard's resident superhero by night. He possesses a mix of courageous altruism and a gigantic arrogance and ego, two drives that constantly clash during his adventures - in "Just Us Justice Ducks", he was initially mortified that he'd be getting help against the Fearsome Five. Darkwing's origins are rather fuzzy. On one hand, he frequently claims to be a superhero on the day he became Darkwing Duck after his teenage days. On the other hand, during his childhood and teenage days, Drake was a complete dork; by his high school days, however, he'd already developed an obsession with crime-fighting ("Crash Reunion"). He's been an active superhero for an unknown number of years. In his earliest days of crimefighting, he was more focused on the headlines from his career, to the extent that in "Darkly Dawns the Duck Part 2" he laments that he has no life outside his showboating and no friends to turn to. Launchpad McQuack and Gosalyn gave him a life and help keep him grounded. In the dystopian future of "Time and Punishment", losing Gosalyn causes him to become obsessive about crime-fighting and devolve into a supervillain. His two recurring catchphrases are "I am the terror that flaps in the night", followed by an improvised metaphor before he gives his name, and the battlecry of "let's get dangerous". Because of loose continuity, there's more than one origin story for why he became Darkwing Duck - starting with "Paraducks" (inspired by his own time-travelling adult self) and ending with "Crash Reunion" (a random disguise so he could defend his high school prom from Megavolt) and "A Star is Scorned".</li>
		<li><strong>Launchpad McQuack (voiced by Terry McGovern)</strong> - Darkwing Duck's sidekick, originally from DuckTales. He refers to Darkwing as "DW" and Darkwing sometimes refers to him as "LP" in return. He's Darkwing's self-proclaimed biggest fan, even spending a year designing the Thunderquack just out of fanboy urges; the hero originally found him annoying but quickly came to see him as a friend. As GizmoDuck also appears in the show, it's confirmed that Launchpad is no longer working for Scrooge. In the episode "Tiff of the Titans" when Fenton comes to visit Lauchpad, he explains to Drake Mallard that "Fenton and I used to work for the same guy".</li>

	<h3>The critics: <a href ="http://articles.latimes.com/1991-04-06/entertainment/ca-1474_1_darkwing-duck-disney">Los Angeles Times</a></h3>
		<p><blockquote>With his long bill, Lone Ranger mask, billowing cape and outsized slouch hat, Darkwing looks suspiciously like Daffy Duck in his swashbuckler outfit from Chuck Jones' "The Scarlet Pumpernickel" (1950). The use of Warners-style takes--quick looks at the camera, flickering eyebrows, hammy mock-heroic poses--only emphasizes the similarities.

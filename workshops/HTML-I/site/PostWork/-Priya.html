		<p></p>
		<p>Darkwing Duck is an Animated Action Adventure television series produced by <a href = "http://disney.com/">The Walt Disney Company</a> that ran from 1991â€“1992 on both the syndicated programming block The Disney Afternoon and Saturday mornings on ABC.[1] It featured the eponymous anthropomorphic duck superhero whose alter ego is mild-mannered single quacker Drake Mallard. It is the only direct spin-off of DuckTales.</p>
	<h2> Premise </h2>
	<br>
		<p>Darkwing Duck tells the adventures of the titular superhero, aided by his sidekick and pilot Launchpad McQuack. In his secret identity of Drake Mallard, he lives in an unassuming suburban house with his adopted daughter Gosalyn, next door to the bafflingly dim-witted Muddlefoot family. Darkwing struggles to balance his egotistical craving for fame and attention against his desire to be a good father to Gosalyn and help do good in St. Canard. Most episodes put these two aspects of Darkwing's character in direct conflict, though Darkwing's better nature usually prevails</p>
	<br>
	
	<h2>Main Characters</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Darkwing Duck (voiced by Jim Cummings)-Average citizen by day and St. Canard's resident superhero by night. He possesses a mix of courageous altruism and a gigantic arrogance and ego, two drives that constantly clash during his adventures - in "Just Us Justice Ducks", he was initially mortified that he'd be getting help against the Fearsome Five. </li>
			<li>Launchpad McQuack (voiced by Terry McGovern)-Darkwing Duck's sidekick, originally from DuckTales. He refers to Darkwing as "DW" and Darkwing sometimes refers to him as "LP" in return. </li>
		</ul>

	<h3>The Critics: <a href = "http://articles.latimes.com/1991-04-06/entertainment/ca-1474_1_darkwing-duck-disney">Los Angeles Times</a>
		<p>Having lifted characters and situations from their own features and comic books, as well as from the films of Steven Spielberg, Buena Vista Television's new series, "Darkwing Duck" (which previews on the Disney Channel at 8:30 this morning in anticipation of its debut this fall in syndication and on ABC's Saturday morning lineup) reveals the Disney television animators have found a new source to plunder: the classic Warner Bros. cartoons.</p>

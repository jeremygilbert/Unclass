This animated action adventure television series produced by <a href="www.thewaltdisneycompany.com">
The Walt Disney Company</a> ran from 1991-1992 on the Disney Channel. It featured the eponymous
 anthropomorphic duck superhero whose alter ego is mild-mannered single quacker Drake Mallard. 
 It is the only direct spin-off of DuckTales.</p>
<h2>Premise</h2>
<p>Darkwing Duck tells the adventures of the titular superhero, aided by his sidekick and pilot
Launchpad McQuack. In his secret identity of Drake Mallard, he lives in an unassuming suburban 
house with his adopted daughter Gosalyn, next door to the bafflingly dim-witted Muddlefoot family. 
Darkwing struggles to balance his egotistical craving for fame and attention against his desire 
to be a good father and help do good in St. Canard.</p>
<h2>Main Characters</h2> 
<ul><li><strong>Darkwing Duck/Drake Mallard</strong> (voiced by Jim Cunnings) - Average citizen 
by day and St. Canard's resident superhero by night. He possesses a mix of courageous altruism 
and a gigantic arrogance and ego, two drives that constantly clash during his adventures - 
in "Just Us Justice Ducks."</li>
<li><strong>Launchpad McQuack</strong> (voiced by Terry McGovern) - 
Darkwing Duck's sidekick, originally from DuckTales. He refers to Darkwing as "DW" and Darkwing 
sometimes refers to him as "LP" in return. He's Darkwing's self-proclaimed biggest fan.</li></ul>
<h3>The Critics: <a href="www.latimes.com">Los Angeles Times</a></h3>
<ul>With his long bill, Lone Ranger mask, billowing cape and outsized slouch hat, Darkwing 
looks suspiciously like Daffy Duck in his swashbuckler outfit from Chuck Jones' "The Scarlet 
Pumpernickel" (1950). The use of Warners-style takes- quick looks at the camera, flickering 
eyebrows, hammy mock-heroic poses- only emphasizes the similarities. But Daffy was funny, 
and this inept crime fighter who describes himself as "..the terror that flaps in the night... 
the winged scourge that pecks at your nightmares" isn't.

<h1>Darkwing Duck</h1>
<p><img src="darkwing_duck.jpg">Darkwing Duck is an Animated Action Adventure television series produced 
by The Walt Disney Company that ran from 1991–1992 on both the syndicated programming block The Disney Afternoon 
and Saturday mornings on ABC.[1] It featured the eponymous anthropomorphic duck 
superhero whose alter ego is mild-mannered single quacker Drake Mallard. It is the only direct spin-off of DuckTales.
<p>
<h2>Premise</h2>
Darkwing Duck tells the adventures of the titular superhero, aided by his sidekick and pilot 
Launchpad McQuack. In his secret identity of Drake Mallard, he lives in an unassuming suburban house with his 
adopted daughter Gosalyn, next door to the bafflingly dim-witted Muddlefoot family. Darkwing struggles to balance 
his egotistical craving for fame and attention against his desire to be a good father to Gosalyn and help do good in St. Canard. 
Most episodes put these two aspects of Darkwing's character in direct conflict, though Darkwing's better nature usually prevails.

<h2>Main Characters</p></h2>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Darkwing Duck/Duck Mallard</strong> (voiced by Jim Cummings) – Average citizen by day and St.
		Canard's resident superhero by night. He possesses a mix of courageous altruism and a gigantic arrogance and ego, 
		two drives that constantly clash during his adventures - in "Just Us Justice Ducks", he was initially mortified that 
		he'd be getting help against the Fearsome Five. 
		<li><strong>Launchpad McQuack</strong> Launchpad McQuack (voiced by Terry McGovern) – Darkwing Duck's sidekick, 
		originally from DuckTales. He refers to Darkwing as "DW" and Darkwing sometimes refers to him as "LP" in return. 
		He's Darkwing's self-proclaimed biggest fan, even spending a year designing the Thunderquack just out of fanboy urges; 
		the hero originally found him annoying but quickly came to see him as a friend.

	</h3>
	<blockquote>With his long bill, Lone Ranger mask, billowing cape and outsized slouch hat, 
	Darkwing looks suspiciously like Daffy Duck in his swashbuckler outfit from Chuck Jones' "The Scarlet Pumpernickel" (1950). 
	The use of Warners-style takes--quick looks at the camera, flickering eyebrows, hammy mock-heroic poses--only emphasizes the similarities.

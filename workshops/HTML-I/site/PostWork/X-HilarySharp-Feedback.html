Hilary,

Wow. Very clean code -- and semantic. I'm impressed. Great tabs and spacing. I'm glad you were already exploring the SECTION tag. Have you done this before? 

The only thing you might want to changes is that IMG tags, in HTML5, do not need to a closing slash -- that's only in XHTML. And make sure you have an ALT tag. And all IMG tags should be inside a block level element.
